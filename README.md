c++ parser


23:11 < Kod> hmm that would be basic enough I guess
23:11 < primepie> it's basic and can get as advanced as you like
23:12 < Kod> will teach how to make a lib, some string work, some I/O
23:12 < primepie> I'd like it to support utf8 as well
23:12 < Kod> okay
23:12 < primepie> iterators, objct lifetime, class interfaces
23:13 < Kod> okie simple enough
23:13 < primepie> how will you present me a record? who's responsible to allocate and free this obj? what happens if I assign it to another obj ?
23:13 < primepie> and of course, it teaches you how to write state machines / parsers
23:13 < primepie> now what if the data is not coming from a file but over the wire? how hard will it be to use this lib of yours?
23:14 < elventails> wou ess
23:14 < elventails> karajit 7akeh hon?
23:14 < primepie> lol
23:14 < Kod> eh eh
23:14 < elventails> fata7it ma3o la Kod hay2ita
23:14  * elventails scrolls back
23:14 < Kod> lol
23:14 < primepie> eh hek shi :P
23:15 < primepie> so you have all the requirements.. save them in a note and got for it
23:16 < Kod> okie
23:16 < primepie> Kod: also think of how easy will it be for me to iterate over the records? when does it stop? (eof, socket closes ? etc.. )
